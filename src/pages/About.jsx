        The Ethiopian Federal Public Procurement system has undergone significant changes over the years, including the adoption of a bid management system to streamline the procurement process. 

In 2003, Ethiopia established the Public Procurement and Property Administration Agency (PPPAA) to oversee public procurement at the federal level. The agency's main objective was to ensure transparency, fairness, and efficiency in the procurement process. 

In 2008, the PPPAA implemented an electronic procurement system called the Ethiopian Government Procurement System (EGPS). The EGPS was designed to automate the procurement process and make it more transparent and efficient. The system allowed bidders to submit their bids electronically, and for procurement officials to evaluate and award contracts online.

In 2014, the PPPAA upgraded the EGPS to include a bid management system. The new system, known as the Ethiopian National Public Procurement System (NPPS), allowed bidders to submit their bids online and track the status of their bids in real-time. The system also provided procurement officials with tools to manage and evaluate bids more efficiently.

The NPPS has significantly improved the efficiency and transparency of the public procurement process in Ethiopia. It has reduced the time and cost of procuring goods and services, and has increased competition among bidders. The system has also improved data management and analysis, which has helped the government to make more informed procurement decisions.

Overall, the adoption of a bid management system has been a key milestone in the evolution of the Ethiopian Federal Public Procurement system. It has helped to modernize and streamline the procurement process, making it more transparent, efficient, and accessible for all stakeholders involved.
